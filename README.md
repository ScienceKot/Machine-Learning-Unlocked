# Machine-Learning-Unlocked
This repository includes the materials from the event series - Machine Learning Unlocked by Sigmoid and Tekwill Academy

# To be able to use this materials you should perform some installation on your machine.
1) Install python 3.7.x
    Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and choose a 3.7.x version, becouse these are more stable versions.
    Install python and test the installation by typing in the terminal or cmd 'python'. If you see something like this:
      Python 3.6.7 (v3.6.7:6ec5cf24b7, Oct 20 2018, 13:35:33) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
    If not, acces the following link - https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html
2) Installing numpy.
    In the cmd or terminal type: 
      'pip install numpy' and hit enter.
    pip comes from 'package installer for python'. It allows us to install, update or delete python packages.
    In the following steps I will show only the commands. What every library is for I will show doring the workshops.
3) Installing pandas.
      pip install pandas.
4) Installing matplotlib.
      pip install matplolib.
5) Installing seaborn.
      pip install seaborn.
6) Installing scikit-learn.
      pip install -U scikit-learn
7) Installing kydavra:
      pip install kydavra
8) Installing jupyter notebook:
      pip install notebook

# Now that you created the environment you should now download the data:
Download the folder 'Data' from this repository. It contains 2 files.
1) Dataset_Agreement.pdf - please be sure that you read it. There are limitations of the using this dataset.
2) yelp_academic_dataset_business.json - The dataset that we will use doring the Workshops.

Thank you,
With love by Sigmoid
